this project is based on [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a monorepo package manager. Because it's better, faster, slimmer than yarn or npm and supports monorepos without the lerna hassle and yarn incompatibilities right out of the box

```
pnpm install
cd packages/contracts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat console
```
