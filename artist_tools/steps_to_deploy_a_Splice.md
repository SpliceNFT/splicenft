**Steps to deploy a Splice** <br /> 
Here are a few links and details for artists to test and deploy Splice style algorithms.

**1. Write your algorithm** <br /> 
Details on how best to do that can be found [here.](https://splicenft.github.io/splicenft/artists/)<br />
Please note that our input parameters have been updated to include not just an RGB array, but also information about the prevalence of colors in a seed NFT.


**2. Test it** <br /> 
Test your Splice algorithm [here.](https://getsplice.io/#/create) <br /> 
Please be sure your wallet is connected to mainnet to get the palette extractor working.


**3. Deploy it!** <br /> 
Send us:<br /> - Your eth wallet address to receive revenue from sales
<br /> - Your style code
<br /> - The cap on your series (how many can be minted)
<br /> - Its price 
<br /> - Metadata text <br />
Here's an example:

{ <br /> 
  "name": "District 1618", <br /> 
  "description": "District 1618 generates a pattern based on the droste effect and golden mean (1.618).", <br /> 
  "properties": {}, <br /> 
  "splice": { <br /> 
    "creator_name": "Splice Genesis", <br /> 
    "creator_twitter": "https://twitter.com/splicenft", <br /> 
    "creator_url": "https://getsplice.io", <br /> 
    "code_library": "p5.js", <br /> 
    "code_library_version": "1.4.0", <br /> 
    "license": "CC BY-NC-ND 4.0" <br /> 
  } <br /> 
} <br /> 

**Excited to see what you build!**
