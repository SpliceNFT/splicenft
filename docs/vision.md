### Additional ideas, short term

We're capping the minting of tokens on an input collection basis. You can't mint as many backgrounds as there are tokens in the origin collection. 

Requestors must pay a minting fee to 

- pay oracle fees (LINK)
- pay royalties to the style artist (sent to the current owner of the style NFT)
- give back a share to the origin collection (since we're deriving from their original idea)
- keep a small share to our own DAO

Once the original piece is sold, the contract transfers the Splice ownership too (if this should happen automatically we need some hook that the origin NFT contracts can call back, adding gas fees to their transfer tx)

### mid term
Minting fees can be dynamic, using a bonding curve that takes several aspects into account:

- the current market price of the requestor's NFT (for this we'll need an oracle that signals the collection's floor price or, even better, a floor for the tier of the origin NFT: e.g. some cats are cooler than others). For this we could use rarity.tools as one source for oracle data
- the background collection's current supply: as supply dwindles, prices go up
- a fee structure defined by the style artist

If we were to add this, we might define a cap on that fee or (reverse?) auction it proportionally with respect to the date/time a collection is generated by Splice.
