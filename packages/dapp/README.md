# Dapp

created with CRA / TS

## Dependencies

this dapp needs artifacts from the contracts package. Currently they're symlinked. Compile all contracts in the contracts package first, then start this project.

#### Environment

copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and add the contract addresses that you got when deploying on your hardhat node. Note that CRAs only can access env vars prefixed with `REACT_APP_`
